# Breast Cancer Predictor

This is an application developed to assist in breast cancer diagnosis. It utilizes a machine learning model to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on cell measurements obtained from a biopsy.

## How to Use

1. **Connect to Cytology Lab:** Connect this app to your cytology lab to provide cell measurements. You can also manually update the measurements using the sliders in the sidebar.

2. **Measurement Visualization:** The radar chart displays cell measurements in different categories such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension.

3. **Cell Cluster Prediction:** Based on the provided measurements, the app makes a prediction about whether the tumor is benign or malignant. It also provides the probability of belonging to each class.

**Note:** This app can assist medical professionals in diagnosis but should not be used as a substitute for professional diagnosis.
